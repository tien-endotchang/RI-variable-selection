#' Simulations for best subset selection in regression
#'
#' Tools for running simulations that compare best subset selection in 
#'   regression to other common sparse regression estimators such as the
#'   lasso and forward stepwise.
#'
#' The simulation setup is based on the paper: "Best subset selection via a
#'   modern optimization lens" by Dimitris Bertsimas, Angela King, and Rahul
#'   Mazumder, Annals of Statistics, 44(2), 813-852, 2016.
